Peer Review: The code works and the desktop looks very similar to the requirement as needed. But there are just a few things I want to point out. The user's card color is the wrong color, the three dots next to the card tiles are missing and the three buttons on the user's card don't turn white when hovered. But other than those things, the CSS, JS, and the page are very good.
